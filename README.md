Project Anon Message Board
Created using Node.js v 10.3.2 and Express
Using Mongodb as a Database and Helmet.js for security features

To make it work:
1) Create a .env file and set NODE_ENV to `test` without quotes and DB to your databases connection string, which would be given to you by MongoDB. 

Work completed:
1) Created controllers/handlers to handle routing in routes/api.js
2) Added security features to `server.js`
3) Created all of the functional/unit tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`
